### 2. How do Low Fat vs Regular items contribute to total sales?

- **Low Fat** products account for ~64% ( $0.78 M ) of total sales, while **Regular** products make up ~36% ($0.43 M).
- **Opportunity:** Promote targeted ‚ÄúLow Fat‚Äù campaigns; this segment is driving the majority of revenue.
  
### 3. Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
```sql
SELECT 
  Item_Type,
  ROUND(CAST(SUM(Sales) / 1000 AS numeric), 2) AS Total_Sale
FROM fair_price_data
GROUP BY Item_Type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```

- **Fruits & Vegetables** ($178 K) and Snack Foods ($175 K) lead sales, together representing >30% of category revenue.
- **Opportunity:** Reevaluate pricing, promotions, or in-store placement for underperforming categories like Seafood.
- 
### 4. How do sales vary across location tiers and outlet sizes?
#### Location tiers 
```sql
WITH sales_by_fat AS (
  SELECT
    Outlet_Location_Type,
    Item_Fat_Content,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(Sales) / 1000 AS numeric), 2) AS Total_Sales
  FROM fair_price_data
  GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type, Item_Fat_Content
)
SELECT
  Outlet_Location_Type,
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'Low Fat' THEN Total_Sales END), 0) AS low_fat_sales,
  COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'Regular' THEN Total_Sales END), 0) AS regular_sales
FROM sales_by_fat
GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type
ORDER BY Outlet_Location_Type;
```
Result: 

<img width="410" height="117" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 05 04‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446a7006-b37c-4fca-ab88-acf85094578b" />

- **Tier 3** stores generate the highest total sales for both Low Fat ($307 K) and Regular ($165 K).
- **Tier 1** stores trail by ~30% in combined sales.
- **Opportunity:** Expand Tier 3 best practices (product mix, shelving) into Tier 1 locations to boost sales there.

#### Outlet sizes
```sql
WITH size_totals AS (
  SELECT 
    Outlet_Size,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(Sales) / 1000 AS numeric), 2) AS Total_Sales
  FROM fair_price_data
  GROUP BY Outlet_Size
)
SELECT
  Outlet_Size,
  Total_Sales,
  ROUND(Total_Sales * 100.0 / SUM(Total_Sales) OVER (), 2) AS Sales_Percentage
FROM size_totals
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
Result: 

<img width="417" height="115" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 09 16‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58f3aca-f298-4089-a745-b1f20ddfbe85" />

- **Medium-sized** outlets capture 42% of total sales, followed by **Small** at 37%, and **High** at 21%.
- Despite larger footprint, **High-size** stores underperform relative to **Medium**.
- **Opportunity:** Audit High-size outlets for assortment gaps or promotional execution issues.

### What is the average product rating, sales, and item visibility, and does it vary by outlet or category?
```sql
SELECT
  Outlet_Type,
  ROUND(CAST(SUM(Sales) / 1000.0 AS numeric), 2) AS total_sales,  
  COUNT(*) AS num_items,      
  ROUND(CAST(AVG(Sales) AS numeric), 0) AS avg_sales,       
  ROUND(CAST(AVG(Rating) AS numeric), 1) AS avg_rating,     
  ROUND(CAST(SUM(item_visibility) AS numeric), 0) AS item_visibility 
FROM fair_price_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Type
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
Result:

<img width="667" height="141" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 26 48‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f8d6fb-09be-4d2b-8596-db61fb27a9c8" />

#### Customer Ratings
- **Average rating** holds at (~4.0) across all segments, indicating stable customer satisfaction.
- **Opportunity:** Introduce targeted feedback loops in Tier 1 or High-size stores to sustain or raise perception further.

#### Store Age (Establishment Year) Trends
- **Newer stores (established 2018)** saw a revenue bump to $205K (50%) above the 10-year average of (~$132 K).
- **Older outlets (2010-2012)** started lower ($78K) but have steadily grown.
- **Opportunity**: Leverage learnings from the 2018 cohort‚Äôs design and rollout to rejuvenate older locations.

### Which business areas can be optimized to improve revenue and satisfaction?
- **Promotional Focus:** Roll out ‚ÄúLow Fat‚Äù cross-category bundles in Tier 1 outlets to capture incremental share.
- **Category Revitalization:** Test limited-time offers on lagging categories (Seafood, Breakfast) with eye-catching in-store displays.
- **Outlet Audit:** Conduct operational reviews at Underperforming ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù outlets to uncover merchandising or assortment issues.
- **Best Practice Sharing:** Document and replicate the product mix and marketing tactics from top-performing Tier 3 and 2018 stores across the network.
- **A/B Test Layouts:** Pilot new shelf layouts in Medium and High-size outlets to optimize product visibility and basket size.
  
By acting on these insights, FairPrice can better align product mix, promotional focus, and store execution to sustain growth and optimize profitability.
